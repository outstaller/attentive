# Attentive CMS - מערכת ניהול כיתה

Attentive is a dual-mode **Classroom Management System** built with Electron, React, and Node.js. It operates entirely over the local network (LAN) without requiring external servers.

## ✨ Features

### 👨‍🏫 Teacher Mode (Host)
- **Classroom Setup**: Easy setup for teacher name and class name.
- **Student Discovery**: Automatically detects students on the local Wi-Fi.
- **Dashboard**: Real-time grid view of connected students.
- **Controls**:
  - 🔴 **Lock All**: Instantly lock all student screens.
  - 🟢 **Unlock All**: Release control of all screens.
  - ❌ **Disconnect All**: Disconnect all students and reset their connection.
  - 🔓 **Individual Control**: Lock/Unlock/Disconnect specific students.

### 👨‍🎓 Student Mode (Client)
- **Auto-Discovery**: Listens for teacher beacons via UDP to find available classes.
- **One-Click Connect**: Simple connection process requiring only name and grade.
- **Kiosk Lock**:
  - When locked, a full-screen "Eyes on Teacher" window appears.
  - Blocks `Alt+Tab`, `Esc`, `F11`, and other common shortcuts.
  - **Dead Man's Switch**: Auto-unlocks after 60 minutes if connection is lost or teacher forgets.
  - **Fail-Safe**: Unlocks immediately if the network connection drops.
- **Disconnection**: Handles distinct messages when disconnected by the teacher ("Kicked").

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Electron
- **UI**: React + TypeScript (Hebrew/RTL support)
- **Networking**:
  - **Discovery**: UDP Broadcast (`dgram`)
  - **Real-time Comms**: `socket.io` (TCP)
- **Persistence**: `electron-store` for saving user preferences.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm / yarn

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attentive.git
cd attentive
npm install
```

### Running the Application
Currently, the application runs as a single codebase with a mode selector at startup.

```bash
# Start the development version
npm start
```
On launch, select **"אני מורה" (Teacher)** or **"אני תלמיד" (Student)**.

## 🏗 Architecture & Building

### Project Structure
- `src/main/`: Electron Main process (Window management, Network services, System locks).
- `src/ui/`: React Renderer process (UI layouts).
- `src/services/`: Core logic (Network logic, LockManager).
- `src/shared/`: Shared Types and Constants.

### Packaging
We use `electron-builder` with NSIS to create installers that automatically configure Windows Firewall.

**Build Teacher Installer:**
```bash
npm run dist:teacher
```

**Build Student Installer:**
```bash
npm run dist:student
```

The output installers will be in the `release/` directory.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Firewall**: The installer acts as a helper to configure Windows Firewall rules for "Attentive". If running from source, assume UDP Port `41234` and TCP Port `3000` need to be allowed.
- **Kiosk Limitations**: On Windows/Mac, blocking system keys like `Ctrl+Alt+Del` or `Cmd+Option+Esc` requires lower-level OS permissions or signed drivers, which is out of scope for pure Electron. The current implementation uses "best effort" blocking suitable for standard classroom environments.

## 🔄 Auto-Update Mechanism
The application uses `electron-updater` with a generic provider hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Configuration
1.  **Repo**: Updates are hosted at `https://outstaller.github.io/attentive/update-manager/`.
2.  **Structure**:
    - `.../update-manager/student/` -> Contains student updates
    - `.../update-manager/teacher/` -> Contains teacher updates

### How to Deploy an Update
1.  **Increment Version**: Update `version` in `package.json`.
2.  **Build**:
    ```bash
    npm run dist:teacher
    npm run dist:student
    ```
3.  **Upload**:
    - Copy the generated `.exe`, `.blockmap`, and `latest.yml` files from `release/teacher` to your GitHub Pages `update-manager/teacher` folder.
    - Do the same for student files in `update-manager/student`.
4.  **Push**: Commit and push changes to GitHub. The apps will detect the new version on next launch (or within 1 hour).
